## Synergized Model for Predicting Sepsis and Jaundice

This project integrates two machine learning models for predicting **Sepsis** (from tabular clinical data) and detecting **Jaundice** (from eye images), with a unified web interface built using **Streamlit**. The project aims to showcase early disease prediction using AI techniques in a user-friendly application.

## Project Structure

- `sepsis_model/` â€” Code and trained model for sepsis prediction using tabular data.
- `jaundice_model/` â€” Code and trained CNN model for jaundice detection from images.
- `streamlit_app/` â€” Web interface allowing users to interact with both models.
- `data/` â€” Sample data files for testing the models.
- `requirements.txt` â€” All necessary Python packages.

3. Run the Streamlit App streamlit run autism_app.py

## Models Used
ðŸ”¹ Sepsis Prediction
Model: XGBoost Classifier (XGBClassifier)
Input: Clinical tabular data (e.g., HR, O2Sat, MAP, Resp, etc.)
Output: Probability of Sepsis (Binary Classification)
Source Code Adapted From:Lakshya Soniâ€™s Kaggle Notebook
Dataset:Prediction of Sepsis Dataset

ðŸ”¹ Jaundice Detection
Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Input: Eye images (normal vs jaundiced)
Output: Classification as Normal or Jaundiced
Approach Adapted From:Nirmal Gaudâ€™s Notebook
Dataset: Eye images preprocessed from the above source

## Web Interface
The unified Streamlit app allows:

-Uploading a user input for Sepsis prediction

-Uploading an image for Jaundice detection

-Visualizing prediction outputs with confidence levels

-Educational demonstration of healthcare AI

## Acknowledgements
-Sepsis prediction logic and code were adapted from:Lakshya Soniâ€™s Kaggle Notebook

-Sepsis dataset used:Prediction of Sepsis Dataset

-Jaundice classification method adapted from:Nirmal Gaudâ€™s Notebook
**Note:** The machine learning models for both sepsis and jaundice were trained independently and are original to this project.
The Streamlit web interface was designed and implemented as a unified platform to demonstrate both models interactively.
No direct code from the above sources was reused without modification. Instead, concepts and logic were adapted and extended.
