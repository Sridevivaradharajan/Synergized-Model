## Synergized Model for Predicting Sepsis and Jaundice

This project integrates two machine learning models for predicting **Sepsis** (from tabular clinical data) and detecting **Jaundice** (from eye images), with a unified web interface built using **Streamlit**. The project aims to showcase early disease prediction using AI techniques in a user-friendly application.

## Project Structure

- `sepsis_model/` — Code and trained model for sepsis prediction using tabular data.
- `jaundice_model/` — Code and trained CNN model for jaundice detection from images.
- `streamlit_app/` — Web interface allowing users to interact with both models.
- `data/` — Sample data files for testing the models.
- `requirements.txt` — All necessary Python packages.
