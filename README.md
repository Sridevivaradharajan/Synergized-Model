## Synergized Model for Predicting Sepsis and Jaundice

This project integrates two machine learning models for predicting **Sepsis** (from tabular clinical data) and detecting **Jaundice** (from eye images), with a unified web interface built using **Streamlit**. The project aims to showcase early disease prediction using AI techniques in a user-friendly application.

## Project Structure

- `sepsis_model/` — Code and trained model for sepsis prediction using tabular data.
- `jaundice_model/` — Code and trained CNN model for jaundice detection from images.
- `streamlit_app/` — Web interface allowing users to interact with both models.
- `data/` — Sample data files for testing the models.
- `requirements.txt` — All necessary Python packages.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
2. Install Required Libraries pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit App streamlit run autism_app.py

## Models Used
🔹 Sepsis Prediction
Model: XGBoost Classifier (XGBClassifier)
Input: Clinical tabular data (e.g., HR, O2Sat, MAP, Resp, etc.)
Output: Probability of Sepsis (Binary Classification)
Source Code Adapted From:Lakshya Soni’s Kaggle Notebook
Dataset:Prediction of Sepsis Dataset

🔹 Jaundice Detection
Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Input: Eye images (normal vs jaundiced)
Output: Classification as Normal or Jaundiced
Approach Adapted From:Nirmal Gaud’s Notebook
Dataset: Eye images preprocessed from the above source

## Web Interface
The unified Streamlit app allows:
-Uploading a user input for Sepsis prediction
-Uploading an image for Jaundice detection
-Visualizing prediction outputs with confidence levels
-Educational demonstration of healthcare AI
